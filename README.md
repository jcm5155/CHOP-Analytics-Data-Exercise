# CHOP-Analytics-Data-Exercise
 My solution for the data analytics Data Exercise from CHOP Analytics 
 
 To test my work, please download their repository (https://github.com/chop-analytics/analyst-take-home-task) and place my data_ex.py in the root of the repository directory. My script expects the CHOP dataset .csv files to be located in their default locations and will output my solution to file.csv
