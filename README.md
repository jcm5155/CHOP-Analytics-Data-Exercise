# CHOP-Analytics-Data-Exercise
 My solution for the data analytics Data Exercise from CHOP Analytics

 I'm using this exercise as a hands-on way to learn about data analysis modules(such as pandas and numpy). As such, there are currently 2 different versions of my solution.

   1) data_ex_pd.py -> data_ex_pd_solution.csv
   This is my latest solution for the exercise. It's a lot more pandas-centric and is an order of 
   magnitude faster than my old solution. It's probably very unoptimized still, but it's a work in progress.

   2) data_ex_old.py -> data_ex_old_solution.csv
   I worked on this solution before I started learning pandas.
   It's basically "pure python" and as as result is pretty slow.

 To test my work, please download CHOP's repository (https://github.com/chop-analytics/analyst-take-home-task) and place my data_ex_pd.py in the root of the repository directory. My script expects the CHOP dataset .csv files to be located in their default locations and will output my solution to data_ex_pd_solution.csv
