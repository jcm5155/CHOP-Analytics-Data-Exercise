# CHOP-Analytics-Data-Exercise
My solution for the data analytics Data Exercise from CHOP Analytics (overview at https://github.com/chop-analytics/analyst-take-home-task). I'm using this exercise as a hands-on way to learn about data analysis modules(such as pandas and numpy).

Please view **CHOP Data Exercise.ipynb** for an annotated walkthrough of my solution.

If you would like to test my work, please download CHOP's repository and run data_ex_pd.py from the root of the repository directory. My script expects the CHOP dataset .csv files to be located in their default locations and will output my solution to data_ex_pd_solution.csv.
